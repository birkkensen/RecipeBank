Hyper Island - The Fundamentals

### :open_file_folder: The Brief:

Create a project of your own choosing, explore the code and integrate a little javascript. A secondary objective was to fetch posts from a data source e.g. JSON file or WordPress CMS.



### :hourglass_flowing_sand: Time spent / Deadline:

6 weeks

### :dart: Goals:

I went with a personal recipe bank and set the following goals:
- Get the basics of Git and using github
- Build a responsive site across any device
- Build something I can use and continue to work on
- Use a CMS like wordpress to easily update my posts.
- Explore JS as much as possible

### :grimacing: The process:

This being the first project it took me some time to figure out what to do without setting the 
bar to high for myself. I didn't have any prior knowledge of JS but some in other languages like Java.
Having the understanding for the syntax (like for-loops, if-else, swith-statement, variables etc) was very nice. 

I think I spent the most time writing / exploring javascript and working with fetching data from Wordpress.


### :blue_book: Learnings:

- Learned alot about REST APIs
- Working with Wordpress
- Really went to town using for loops :sweat_smile:
- SVG animations, using Figma to create the SVG
- Feeling overall more confident with HTML, CSS, JS.
